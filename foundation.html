                    <h1>Life story of the late Archbishop John Njenga</h1>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>
                      The late Archbishop Emeritus John Joseph Njenga was born
                      on the 25th of December, 1928 in Karambainĩ Village,
                      Tigoni Location in Limuru Division to Mzee Kĩmani wa
                      Therebũ and Mama Maria Wanjirũ. He was named after his
                      father’s eldest brother in line with the Kikuyu naming
                      tradition. Njenga was the last born in a family of eight
                      children. Unfortunately, only five of his siblings reached
                      maturity due to high infancy mortality rate at the time.
                      Those who survived the infant mortality were; Mũthoni,
                      Nderu, Mwaũra, and Nyambura.

                    <h2 class="mt-5 text-capitalize">JOURNEY TO PRIESTHOOD</h2>
                    <p>
                      John Njenga was admitted at the prestigious Makerere
                      University to study medicine, but instead, he opted to
                      study for the priesthood at the Kibosho Seminary in
                      Tanganyika, old name of Tanzania. His mother whom he loved
                      dearly, was particularly devastated by the news of his
                      decision. She would never see her grandchildren by Njenga!
                      Mami, Njenga assured her, do not worry since I will have
                      many spiritual children who shall fill your life with rare
                      joy. This prophecy turned to be true. During her long
                      life, Mama Wanjirũ hosted countless numbers of Priests,
                      Seminarians, Religious Brothers and Sisters and Laymen and
                      Women, who often called on her, partly because she was the
                      mother of a thriving Bishop. As part of the preparations
                      to join the senior seminary in Tanganyika, he joined
                      Kilimambogo Junior Seminary as an untrained teacher. The
                      year was 1948 and he was about to begin his journey to the
                      priesthood. Having successfully completed his priestly
                      training and formation, Njenga was ordained on February
                      17, 1957 at Lioki Catholic Church by the late John Joseph
                      McCarthy then the Archbishop of Nairobi. Ordination to the
                      priesthood made him a man of many firsts: the first
                      indigenous priest to be ordained in the Archdiocese of
                      Nairobi (previously Fr. Paul Njoroge had been ordained in
                      1942 for the Vicariate of Zanzibar, died and his remains
                      interred in Rome); the first ordained priest from Lioki
                      Parish; the first local priest to publicly baptize his
                      mother on his ordination day (his father had been baptized
                      few years before). In his letter to Archbishop James Knox,
                      the Apostolic Delegate to the then British East Africa,
                      Archbishop McCarthy described the event articulately.
                      There were 50 priests and 50,000 faithful in an atmosphere
                      highly charged with pride, joy and reverence.

                            After the demise of Bishop Emilio Njerū, the then
                            Auxilliary Bishop of Eldoret, on 4th of October,
                            1970, he was appointed the new Bishop of the
                            Catholic Diocese of Eldoret. His Principal
                            Consecrator was Archbishop Pierluigi Sartorelli, the
                            then Apostolic Nuncio in Kenya, thus he inherited an
                            authentic apostolic succession. He chose as motto to
                            guide his episcopate the words, Upendo na Utumishi
                            Kwa Watu wa Mungu (Love and Service to the People of
                            God). The Diocese of Eldoret under Bishop Njenga
                            comprised the districts of Eldoret, Kitale, Nandi,
                            parts of Pokot and Kakamega. <br />
                            Under Njenga, new Harambee schools were established
                            in Eldoret such as; St. Paul’s Lugari, Kimoning,
                            Kamngetuny, Bishop Njenga Girls, Chekalini, Matunda
                            Day, Timboroa, Likuyani, Lukhuna, Nzoia (now St.
                            Anne’s), Turbo and St. Luke’s Lumakanda just to
                            mention a few. Bishop Njenga took up office at a
                            time when the main emphasis was on building a
                            self-reliant church: self- sustaining,
                            self-ministering and self-propagating. The landmark
                            Sacred Heart Cathedral in Eldoret, that was
                            officially opened on June 21 1987 is one of his
                            memorable structural contributions. <br />
                            With the benefit of hindsight, what Njenga achieved
                            in Eldoret, given the relatively short span of time
                            he ministered there, makes it difficult not to
                            invoke the hand of God in his life and mission.
                            Bishop Maurice Crowley sums up well Njenga’s tenure
                            in Eldoret when he says: …In fact, nobody can stand
                            and accuse him of misusing church funds to enrich
                            himself or spend carelessly in unplanned generosity…
                            It was in Eldoret that he served the longest period
                            as an ordinary (18 years).

                            On 25th of October 1988, Bishop Njenga was
                            transferred to Mombasa and was installed as the
                            Ordinary on the 12th of February, 1989. On the 21st
                            of May 1990, he was made the first Metropolitan
                            bishop of Mombasa. <br />
                            After Nairobi and Eldoret, he carried along his
                            charism for education to the then Coast Province and
                            thus in 1990, the construction and rehabilitation of
                            St. Mary’s Teachers Training College in Bura/Taita
                            commenced in earnest. Soon thereafter, St. Teresa
                            Girls Secondary School in Chaani, was established.
                            Also established around this time was Bishop Njenga
                            Secondary School in Taita-Taveta District, Youth
                            Polytechnic in Mikindani, Makupa School for
                            Tailoring, orphanage in Bur-a Mission, Marianist
                            Centre for the training of young boys and girls in
                            carpentry and hairdressing, a street children center
                            in Mikindani and Pwani School of Mentally
                            Handicapped Children, inexhaustible list! He opened
                            a chain of new parishes and re-established some
                            previously suppressed ones. He helped establish
                            perhaps the largest anti-HIV/AIDS strategic unit in
                            the region to help combat the virus domiciled at
                            Mikindani parish. Archbishop Njenga was keen on the
                            theological and professional formation of the
                            clergy, the religious and laity. He shall be
                            perpetually immortalized as the canonical founder of
                            the Sisters of Mary Mother of God of Mombasa, and a
                            hosting bishop of a contingent of religious
                            Congregations and religious personnel that he
                            invited to work in the dioceses that he worked in.
                            <br />
                            His efforts in helping the victims of the 1997
                            politically instigated Likoni clashes and his brave
                            reprimand of civil authorities showed that he was a
                            vigilant protector and defender of the afflicted.
                            <br />
                            Besides his service to respective dioceses where he
                            worked, he also served as the Chairman of the Kenya
                            Episcopal Conference from 1976 to 1982. Having
                            attained the mandatory retirement age, in July 2005,
                            at the Holy Ghost Cathedral in Mombasa, Njenga gave
                            his final farewell address to the Christians of the
                            Catholic Archdiocese of Mombasa where he served for
                            17 years.
